Want to eliminate single point of failure. This can be done using a two-tier achtitecture.

Follow the normal steps to launch your ec2 instance and ssh into it. Once done,

```sudo apt install nginx -y```

You should then be able to use public ip address in webbrowers and see the nginx brand.

To copy a folder locally to your ec2 instance enter the following command into a separate terminal:

```   ```
The scp command first needs to know where your pem file is located, then where the folder you want to transfer is located then finally, where on the ec2 instance you want to save the file.
